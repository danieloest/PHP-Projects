# Introduction
This repository contains all of my PHP Projects, both big and small. My largest project in PHP is an e-commerce website.

# E-commerce website
The e-commerce website uses PHP as a server side language to communicate with a PostgreSQL database in order to create, update, and delete products and authenticate account registration and login.
